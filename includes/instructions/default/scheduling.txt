<h1>Task Presentation</h1>
<p>In the top right corner of the screen, the participant has a planner, which indicates for each task (symbolized by a capital letter and a timeline), the phases during which it will be active.</p>
<p>There is also an automation system, capable of sharing the workload with the participant. When automation is active for a given task, the planner symbolizes it.</p>
<p>This helps the participant to manage their effort and the allocation of their resources.</p>
